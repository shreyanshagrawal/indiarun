    You are an expert startup advisor and financial analyst.
    I have a product idea with the following computed unit economics:
    
    - Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): ${metrics.get('cac')}
    - Average Revenue Per User (ARPU): ${metrics.get('arpu')}
    - Service Delivery Cost (COGS): ${metrics.get('service_delivery_cost')}
    - Customer Lifetime (Months): {metrics.get('customer_lifetime_months')}
    
    Computed Metrics:
    - Gross Margin: ${metrics.get('gross_margin')}
    - Lifetime Value (LTV): ${metrics.get('ltv')}
    - CAC Payback Period: {metrics.get('cac_payback_months')} months
    - LTV:CAC Ratio: {metrics.get('ltv_cac_ratio')}
    
    Provide a concise, 1-2 paragraph "plain-language verdict" about the viability of this business model.
    Is this a healthy business? Are there red flags? (e.g. LTV:CAC < 3 is bad, Payback > 12 months is risky for early stage).
    Write directly to the founder. Do not use markdown backticks for the overall response. Keep it punchy and actionable.
